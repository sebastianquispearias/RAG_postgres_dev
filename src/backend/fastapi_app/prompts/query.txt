Below is a history of the conversation and a new user question which needs to be answered by searching over rows in a database.
You have access to a PostgreSQL database with two main tables:
1. 'veiculos' (vehicles), with columns for vehicle id, manufacturer, model, year, and type.
2. 'abastecimento' (fueling events), with columns for vehicle plate, date, fuel cost, and fuel efficiency.
Generate a search query based on the conversation and the new question. The query should be optimized for semantic search.
If the question is not in English, translate the question to English before generating the search query.
Do not return anything other than the query.
